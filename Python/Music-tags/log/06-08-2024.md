**Advance**

> Phase 3 started: the program to play sounds at the same time is in the first steps implementing threads to manage the tasks at the same time.

> Implemented threads system in hard way, the worker and tasks are not completely understood.

**Problems**

> The threading system does not allow the user to finish the program in an specific time.

> The threads are not fully understood and that is difficult to manage the structure of the program and the work flow.

**Next steps**

> Downolad and convert in images the different tags from the PDF repository.

> Create bank of samples for the sounds.

> Make research about the thread system programming to improve the management of the different tasks.
