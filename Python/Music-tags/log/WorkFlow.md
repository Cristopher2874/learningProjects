### **WorkFlow**

*Phase 1:*
* Prepare the environment: libraries, packages, images, folder
* Learn the basics: AprilTags, usage, description, differences
* Create a simple program to detect AprilTags in an image

*Phase 2:*
* Learn how to use OpenCV to read video from a file or a camera
* Learn how to use OpenCV to detect AprilTags in a video
* Learn how to play sounds based on the detected AprilTags IDs
* Create a program to detect AprilTags in a video and play sounds based on the detected IDs

*Phase 3:*
* Learn how to play sounds at the same time
* Create a program to play the sounds and display the ID's on the live video
* Correct possible issues with multiple detection, sounds at the same time and live interaction with tags.

*Phase 4:*
* Increase the performance with image manipulation to speed up the AprilTag detection and management.
    * Increase the performance with multi-threading to speed up the video processing and sound playing.
    * Increase the performance with GPU acceleration to speed up the video processing and sound playing.
* Create a simple user menu to interact with the application

*Phase 5: extension*
* Detect the distance of the AprilTags, add a range where the sounds are played and not played.
* Add a feature to save the generated rythm.
