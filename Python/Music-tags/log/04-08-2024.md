**Advance**

> Phase 2 compleated, program to detect and display the AprilTag ID's successfully created in live video. The program is also capable of playing sounds in basic scale with an specific format

> Implemented pygame to play the respective sounds

> New github repository found to download bigger PDF versions of the t36h11 family

**Problems**

> The sounds played in the video are played according to the frames and not the length of the audio.

> the audio requires a delay to play the sounds when the april tag detection takes place. Necessary to make corrections in the play time or in the call instruction to call the audios

**Next steps**

> Downolad and convert in images the different tags from the PDF repository.

> Create bank of samples for the sounds.

> Make research about how to execute the sounds in time and how to overlap the sounds in the video whitout any timing. The sound is played currently depending on the time sleep called after, check if it is possible to play it once or during a period.
