**Advance**

> Phase 1 compleated, program to detect and display the AprilTag ID's successfully created.

> Library implemented: pyapriltags from Michigan University

> Generated images with the tag36h11 family of tags in order to make the detection easily. Custom tag 00000 created using pixel art

**Problems**

> the size and resolution of the image from tag 00000 is not enough for bigger image detection. Is necessary to generate tags with better resolution

> the library implemented is not already explored, possible limitations in further steps.

**Next steps**

> Read live video in the program and detect the ID's in each frame

> Improve the detection of the custom tag 00000 by generating tags with better resolution

> Explore the library and its capabilities to improve the detection and add more features

> Make research about how to play the sounds in Python

> Create the samples for the sounds
